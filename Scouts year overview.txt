Here’s a proposed lesson plan outline for SGSA Sea Scouts (Grades 7–8) — based on a weekly 6:15 pm–7:45 pm meeting during the school year.
It’s built around variety, progression, and fun, while still meeting scouting goals.

🗓 Structure Overview

Frequency: Weekly (Tuesdays, 6:15 pm–7:45 pm)

Format per meeting (90 minutes):

6:15–6:25: Opening / Flag / Attendance / Brief announcements

6:25–6:50: Skill-building or lesson segment

6:50–7:35: Hands-on activity or challenge

7:35–7:45: Reflection, announcements, closing
